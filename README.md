Hextech CSS is a framework based in the style of the game League of Legends. This is built with **Bulma v0.7.2**, so all it facilities and features are included! Note that Hextech CSS is **currently in development**. Feel free to create pull requests, issues or fork it and do all your stuff.

## TO-DO List 📝
* Make `is-secondary` button as big as `is-primary`
* Add `is-min` for `is-secondary` button
* Fix the hover color of the arrow on navbar

## Getting started 🛠️
The easiest way to install Hextech CSS is copying/pasting the following code in a file and saving it on your computer, just like we do with Bulma.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="hextech.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="title">Hello Hextech CSS!</h1>
      <a class="button is-primary">Button</a>
    </div>
  </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using Hextech CSS 🎨
Almost every Hextech CSS features are Bulma modifications, so you can just refer to [their docs](https://bulma.io/documentation) to build your project and you will get the Hextech style.

#### Secondary button 👆
We added the `is-secondary` class for buttons. You can use it exactly like any other button, so `<a class="button is-secondary">Example</a>` will result in this:

#### Small button 🐛
We also added `is-min` to make the `is-primary` button smaller **(this feature will be modified soon)**. So you can use `<a class="button is-primary">Tiny button</a>` to get this:

#### Full documentation 📰

I pretend to document every class on the Wiki of this project as the project gets bigger. For now, you can refer to the [demo page](http://gh.imlucas.com.br/hextech).
